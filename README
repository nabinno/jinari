Jinari Is Not A JavaScript IDE.

Well, ok it kind of is. Jinari is an Emacs minor mode that is aimed
towards making Emacs into a top-notch JavaScript and Express development
environment.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The only currently-supported installation method is
via package.el, via Marmalade or MELPA. While other methods might
work, they are unsupported.
